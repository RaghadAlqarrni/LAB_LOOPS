### Sum of Even Numbers

#Write a Python program that prompts the user for a positive integer `n`,
#  and then calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and `n`, inclusive.
#Your program should use a loop (either a `for` loop or a `while` loop) 
# to iterate over the numbers between 1 and `n`, and only add the even numbers to the sum.
#For example:
#Enter a positive integer: 10
#The sum of even numbers between 1 and 10 is 30.
#In this example, the even numbers between 1 and 10 are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, and their sum is 30.
##


n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0: 
        sum += i  #
print(f"The sum of even numbers between 1 and {n} is {sum}.")
